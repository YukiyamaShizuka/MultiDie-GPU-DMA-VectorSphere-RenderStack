# Multi-Die GPU Architecture with Vector-Matrix Fluid Rendering
*Under TreeOS unified deterministic memory model*

This project proposes a multi-chip GPU architecture and a novel rendering model tailored for TreeOS, where deterministic memory access and compute role separation eliminate traditional GPU permission conflicts.

## Architecture Summary

- Each GPU board contains **multiple independent compute chips**
- On-board chips are interconnected via **optical-fiber DMA**, enabling high-speed memory sharing with minimal contention
- All GPU chips operate in **pure compute mode**, without driver-layer arbitration

## Rendering Model

- Fluid simulation is decomposed into **thousands of vector-bound spheres**, each independently computed
- Character models are processed using **dynamic vector-matrix motion graphs**
- A final **composition chip** fuses all outputs and splits them into **24 dynamic output frames** with prediction-aware ordering

## Theoretical Advantages

- Zero-kernel arbitration due to TreeOS path execution
- Ultra-parallel DMA memory sharing via optical fiber bus
- Deterministic frame generation without sync race
- Natural alignment with AI frame prediction and hybrid physics
