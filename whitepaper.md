# Light-Fiber Multi-Die GPU and Vector-Sphere Rendering Model  
*Yukiyama Shizuka, May 2025*

## 1. Abstract

This whitepaper proposes a post-driver GPU architecture based on TreeOS execution paths. It features a compute-only, multi-chip GPU board with optical DMA interconnects, where frame rendering is performed through a vector-sphere model and final compositing is delegated to a specialized output die. Under this model, no kernel arbitration occurs; the operating system provides deterministic compute paths via TreeOS.

## 2. Architectural Overview

### 2.1 Compute Chip Distribution

- A single GPU board contains **4 to 8 compute dies**, each with its own local VRAM.
- **No PCIe bus bottleneck**: intra-board communication uses **fiber-based DMA links** (256–512 Gbps).
- Chips are **not duplicated shaders**, but **dedicated physical units** for simulation, vector motion, composition, and post-processing.

### 2.2 TreeOS Execution Model Compatibility

- TreeOS offers **path-isolated memory leafs**, allowing **non-overlapping execution units** without mutex/semaphore.
- Each die receives its own SapClarify directive stream and compiles execution in local scope.
- OS issues no syscalls during frame construction — **zero driver arbitration latency**.

## 3. Rendering Model: Vector-Sphere Fluid Composition

### 3.1 Fluid Decomposition

- Fluids are decomposed into **granular vector spheres**, each carrying:
  - Position vector
  - Velocity & acceleration
  - Compression potential
  - Opacity & phase delta

- These are **not particles**, but field-aware micro-volume simulants.

### 3.2 Character Motion as Vector Graphs

- Rigid-body skeletal animation is replaced with **matrix-vector graph motion**:
  - Nodes = limb regions
  - Edges = motion potential, elasticity, constraint
  - Entire body motion solved as time-evolving matrix system

### 3.3 Scene Assembly Pipeline

- Pipeline across compute dies:
  1. Fluid Simulation (Die A)
  2. Character Motion Graph (Die B)
  3. Collision & Occlusion Merge (Die C)
  4. Shader-Less Color Propagation (Die D)
  5. Output Composition (Final Die)

## 4. Optical DMA and Memory Interconnects

### 4.1 Fiber Matrix DMA

- Direct **light-fiber matrix interconnects** link VRAM banks of each die.
- Unlike traditional memory buses, data moves at 512Gbps with **zero shared arbitration**.
- DMA access rules are precompiled per frame cycle via SapClarify → no runtime locks.

### 4.2 Latency Profile

- Internal transfer latency: **<1.8μs per chip-hop**
- Composition latency: **<4.5μs for full-scene merge**
- Entire pipeline operates with fixed-cycle sync: **predictable per-frame bounds**

---

## 5. Dynamic Frame Generation

### 5.1 24-Frame Split Model

- Final output is **not 1 frame per cycle**, but **24 dynamic subframes**:
  - Used for AI prediction, per-pixel delay rendering, motion blur compensation
  - Each subframe corresponds to **micro-delta movement cycles**

### 5.2 Benefits

- Enables **AI-aware predictive temporal reconstruction**
- Prepares render stack for **future 1200Hz subpixel displays**
- Works natively with **multi-surface projection**, e.g., headset + glass overlay
